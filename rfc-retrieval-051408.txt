                   Where and how to get new RFCs
                   =============================

RFCs may be obtained via EMAIL or FTP from many RFC Repositories.  The
Primary Repositories will have the RFC available when it is first
announced, as will many Secondary Repositories.  Some Secondary
Repositories may take a few days to make available the most recent
RFCs.

Many of these repositories also now have World Wide Web servers. Try
the following URL as a starting point:

		http://www.rfc-editor.org/


Primary Repositories:

RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET, FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG,
WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU, SRC.DOC.IC.AC.UK, FTP.NCREN.NET, FTP.NIC.IT,
FTP.IMAG.FR, FTP.IETF.RNP.BR WWW.NORMOS.ORG, FTP.GIGABELL.NET,
or OASISSTUDIOS.COM.

1.  NIS.NSF.NET

To obtain RFCs from NIS.NSF.NET via FTP, login with username
"anonymous" and password "name@host.domain"; then connect to the
directory of RFCs with cd /internet/documents.  The file name is
of the form rfcnnnn.txt (where "nnnn" refers to the RFC number).

For sites without FTP capability, electronic mail query is available
from NIS.NSF.NET.  Address the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and
leave the subject field of the message blank.  The first text line of
the message must be "send rfcnnnn.txt" with nnnn the RFC number.

contact:  rfc-mgr@merit.edu

2.  FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG

RFCs can be obtained via FTP from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG, with the
pathname in-notes/rfcnnnn.txt (where "nnnn" refers to the number of
the RFC). Login with FTP username "anonymous" and password
"name@host.domain".

RFCs can also be obtained via electronic mail from FTP.RFC-EDITOR.ORG
by using the RFC-INFO service.  Address the request to
"rfc-info@rfc-editor" with a message body of:

	Retrieve: RFC
	   Doc-ID: RFCnnnn

(Where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC (always use 4 digits -
the DOC-ID of RFC 822 is "RFC0822")).  The RFC-INFO@RFC-EDITOR.ORG
server provides other ways of selecting RFCs based on keywords and
such; for more information send a message to "rfc-info@rfc-editor.org"
with the message body "help: help".

contact: rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org


3.  WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU

RFCs can also be obtained via FTP from WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU, with the
pathname info/rfc/rfcnnnn.txt.Z (where "nnnn" refers to the number of
the
RFC and "Z" indicates that the document is in compressed form).

At WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU the RFCs are in an "archive" file system and
various archives can be mounted as part of an NFS file system.
Please contact Chris Myers (chris@wugate.wustl.edu) if you want to
mount this file system in your NFS.

WUArchive now keeps RFC's and STD's under

   ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu./doc/
   or http://wuarchive.wustl.edu./doc/

contact: chris@wugate.wustl.edu


4.  SUNSITE.ORG.UK (also known as SRC.DOC.IC.AC.UK)

rfc/rfc-index.txt.

For users with good fast Internet connections, the whole archive is
also available by NFS (readonly) and the RFC area can be mounted as,
e.g.

	mount -r sunsite.org.uk:/public/rfc /mnt

RFCs are also available via the web at http://sunsite.org.uk/rfc/
